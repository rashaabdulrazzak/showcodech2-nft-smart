# Basic information
I used the NFT smart contract from the tutorial [NFT Zero to Hero
](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/introduction#:~:text=In%20this%20Zero%20to%20Hero,contract%20that%20supports%20every%20extension.) to deploy it on to my account `actest2.testnet` and Mint an NFT after uploading it to [NFT storage website](https://nft.storage/).
